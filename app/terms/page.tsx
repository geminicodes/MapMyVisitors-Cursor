                <p>
                  MapMyVisitors is offered as a one-time payment product. By purchasing the Service, you agree to pay the specified fee of $29 for lifetime access to the basic plan, with an optional $19 upgrade to remove the watermark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Lifetime Access and Updates:</strong> "Lifetime access" means access to the Service for as long as it remains operational. "Lifetime updates" refers to all updates, improvements, and bug fixes that we release during the lifecycle of the product itself. This does not guarantee the product will operate indefinitely, but rather that you will receive all updates made available while the Service is active.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Payments are processed through our third-party payment provider (Gumroad). All sales are final except as outlined in our Refund Policy. We reserve the right to change pricing for new customers, but existing customers will maintain their original pricing terms.
